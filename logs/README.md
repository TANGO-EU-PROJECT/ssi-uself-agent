# SSI Agent Issuer Logs

The anonymised logs captured on the SSI Agent for issuing Verifiable Credentials in TANGO are as follows:
1. [ePassport VC issuer log](issue-epassport-vc.md)
2. [Customer / Employee VC issuer log](/issue-customer-employee-vc.md)

Note: The [logAnonymizer.html](https://github.com/TANGO-EU-PROJECT/ssi-uself-agent/blob/main/logs/logAnonymizer.html) was used to anonymise the log files. This is a javascript web tool to anonymize SSI log files of personal data including within ID Tokens, Access Tokens, VC JWTs and VP Tokens. It can be downloaded and run in a browser.
